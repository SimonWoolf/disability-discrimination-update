            facts: "In 2008, C , who was a bus driver, suffered a whiplash injury in an accident.  He did not return to work. Initially R’s doctor agreed that C was unfit for work and indicated that C would benefit from physiotherapy to help speed up recovery.  However, in February 2009 R’s doctor (Dr Kahtan) advised that C was fit for work.  She also stated that C had said a number of things which were inconsistent with him having a disability; for example that he was driving his own car, playing football with his children and lifting weights.  After two medical capability hearings C was dismissed for incapability.  C denied that he had been properly examined in February 2009 and denied saying the things that Dr Kahtan alleged he had.  C brought a claim of disability discrimination.  The ET accepted Dr Khatan’s account of the February 2009 meeting and held that C was not disabled.",
            held: "Since the dispute of fact between Dr Khatan and C did not concern all the activities that C said he could not perform and since the ET did not refer to all of C’s activities, C argued that the ET wrongly focused on those activities he could do rather than on those that he could not.  The EAT disagreed and stated that the ET’s acceptance of Dr Khatan’s evidence was an implicit rejection of C’s credibility.

Although the ET, when making its decision, referred to the statutory Guidance, it did not refer to any particular part of it.  C argued that the ET failed to have regard to the statutory Guidance in accordance with the decision in Goodwin v The Patent Office [1999] ICR 302.  The EAT rejected this argument and stated that it was satisfied, from reading the judgment, that the employment Judge understood the potential relevance of the Guidance and the importance of using it correctly.

            comment: "The facts of this case are perhaps more interesting and informative than the discussion of the legal principles.  The Respondent successfully argued that C’s account of his disability was false and that he was not disabled even though C had produced medical evidence from a consultant and his GP and even though R had dismissed C for incapability.  It shows the value of seeking independent medical advice at an early stage and taking a robust approach to the question of whether or not the Claimant has a disability.")

summary: "C succeeded in a claim of disability discrimination in the ET. R appealed firstly on the basis that the ET had
focused on what adjustments R had considered rather than what adjustments it should have made. Secondly R
argued that the ET failed to set out the steps R should have taken to prevent the PCP causing the disadvantage.",
facts: "C was a flight supervisor who became disabled as a result of slipping on some stairs. R moved C into an
administrative role but later, following a TUPE transfer C was told that it was R’s policy that flight staff were only
placed in administrative roles if they were pregnant and C was placed on long term sick leave. After 7 meetings
to discuss C’s attendance R terminated C on the grounds of incapability. During this time a number of alternative
roles arose but R did not consider that they were suitable. However, R neither considered nor produced any
evidence about what adjustments could have been made to those roles to make them more suitable.
Furthermore R did not consider or produce any evidence about whether C could be accommodated in any other
way.
The ET held that the PCP was that, in order to remain in employment, C had to be physically able to do her work
and that therefore her comparators were others who were able to do the work and were not liable to be
dismissed. The ET was scathing about R’s approach to dealing with C’s disability and held that R had not even
considered its duties under the DDA even though it ought to have known that C was disabled.",
held: "HHJ Birtles rejected the argument that the ET focused on what effort R had made rather than on what had
actually been done. The ET had carefully considered all the evidence, including what had been done and what
had not been done. HHJ Birtles held that the comments about R’s failure to even consider reasonable
adjustments simply reflected the fact that it was surprising that an organization of R’s size simply shut its eyes to
the possibility of C being disabled.
HHJ Birtles rejected R’s defence that no specific post had been identified by the ET or C. His Honour stated at
paragraph 27 “It is not for the employee to suggest jobs. It is not for the employee to suggest what adjustments
could be made. It is for the employer to do so. The duty is on the employer to make the investigation. That is for
the very obvious and sensible reason that those are matters which are within the employer’s knowledge.”",
comment: "HHJ BIrtles’ comments in para.27 appear to contradict the numerous authorities following Tarbuck v Sainsbury’s
Supermarket [2006] IRLR 664. However the judgment might be explained by a proper application of the burden
of proof (cf: Project Management Institute v Latif [2007] IRLR 579). When rejecting R’s appeal His Honour relied
upon the paucity of evidence produced by R. R had failed to explain why the vacancies (or other arrangements)
that existed could not be modified so that they were suitable. This requirement for R to explain its conduct is
consistent with C having discharged the burden of proof and in this context HHJ judgment para. 27 is not so
controversial as it seems (NB – there appears to be a mistaken reference to Claimant rather than Appellant in
the last paragraph).")

summary: "The EAT upholds a finding that the College of Law was not required to adjust the time within which it required
disabled persons to sit exams.",
facts: "C, who suffered from Multiple Sclerosis, commenced a course at the College of Law. When sitting his exams the
College gave him 60% more time and the assistance of an amanuensis[1] . Despite these adjustments C failed
business accounts 3 times and was told that he had therefore failed the LPC.
C alleged that R had failed to adjust its requirement for exams to be (a) supervised and (b) completed within a
time limit. He asserted that the exams should not have been timed and that he should have been able to take
them at home, unsupervised. The ET held that the removal of supervision was not a reasonable adjustment as it
would have resulted in a loss of credibility and integrity in the system and would not actually have helped a great
deal. The ET held that the time limit was a competence standard and that there was no duty to adjust it. C
appealed the finding that the requirement to complete the exam within a time limit was a competence standard.

held: "The EAT agreed with the ET’s finding that the requirement to complete the exam within a particular time was a
competence standard under s.14(A)(5) of the DDA 1995. There was evidence before the ET which showed that
the ability to work at speed and under time pressure was a competence. For example the LPC Working Group
had concluded that the assessments should mimic the sort of time-based pressures under which Trainee
Solicitors find themselves having to deal with a client file. The ET was therefore entitled to find that the
requirement for exams to be completed in a particular time was a competence standard which R was not
required to adjust.",
comment: "This case is one of only a few that deal with the competence standards set by qualifications bodies. Cases
concerning competence standards can be helpful in other cases since the principles can be applied to situations
where an employer insists that an employee meet a particular standard of work[2]. The duty to make adjustments
is not intended to require employers to accept a lesser standard of work and adjusting the standard of
performance required of a disabled employee is not necessarily the correct option.
Interestingly the fact that R had actually adjusted the time limit on the exams by 60% was held to be irrelevant to
the question of whether or not the time limit was a competence standard. R was entitled to change its own
competence standards and the fact that the adjustment was made was irrelevant to whether or not the
adjustment was required by the DDA.

keyword_list: " Reasonable Adjustments – Comparator - Constructive Dismissal",
summary: "ET held that the R had failed to make reasonable adjustments and that C had been constructively dismissed.
Appeal allowed.",
facts: "C was an employee of Marks & Spencer who was disabled. She suffered from Tourette’s syndrome and related
OCD, stress and anxiety. R was aware that a few days before C went off sick she was caught shoplifting in
another store on the same street as R’s store. R told C that she would be subjected to disciplinary proceedings
on her return to work. C stated that the shoplifting was a result of her Tourette’s syndrome and asserted that “it
would help immensely if I could return to work without the fear of disciplinary proceedings”. R did not respond to
this suggestion but focused on whether C could return to work. C resigned and claimed constructive dismissal
and disability discrimination.
The ET held that the provision, criterion or practice applied by R was that C should return to work prior to any
disciplinary proceedings being taken against her and that the comparator was a person who was on long term
sick leave but who was not threatened with disciplinary proceedings immediately on her return to work. The ET
held that it would have been a reasonable adjustment to have completed the disciplinary procedures to
determine whether C would be able to return following her sick leave. The ET also held that this amounted to a
constructive dismissal.",
held: "The EAT overturned the ET’s findings on reasonable adjustments. HHJ Birtles held that the ET’s comparator was
incorrect. The proper comparator was identified by reference to the disadvantage caused by the relevant
arrangements – in this case the suspension of all work related issues including disciplinary action while C was
sick. HHJ Birtles identified the correct comparator as a non-disabled person on long term sickness absence who
was threatened with disciplinary proceedings on his return to work. HHJ Birtles said that compared to that
person C was not substantially disadvantaged. In finding that there was no substantial disadvantage HHJ Birtles
also overturned the Tribunal’s finding that C was not capable of returning to work until disciplinary action was
concluded. Neither the medical evidence nor C suggested that C was incapable of returning to work. Finally HHJ
overturned the ET’s finding that it was a reasonable adjustment to commence disciplinary proceedings during
sickness absence. This finding was not supported by the evidence and it would have been unreasonable to
commence the disciplinary proceedings before C had seen a psychologist and while she was on sick leave.",
comment: "The most interesting aspect of this case is that the approach to the comparator in this case does not appear to
accord with the established authorities (although the reasoning is sparse). An application of the principles in
Smith v Churchills Stairflifts [2006] IRLR 41, requires a comparison not only with a person subjected to the
arrangement but also with someone who was not disadvantaged by that arrangement. HHJ Birtles does not
seem to have applied the second part of this test. For more commentary on this issue see the article Comparing
Comparators (March 2011) in the Articles Tab.")

summary: "C was an Adult Instructor in the Army Cadet Force. He was a volunteer and was not paid. The ET held that he
was not a worker within the meaning of DDA 1995, s.68(1) and so could not make a claim of disability
discrimination. C appealed on 3 grounds: (i) that the finding that C was not obliged to do work was perverse; (ii)
that the finding that there was no mutuality of obligation was wrong; and (iii) that the ET should have found that
C was an employee when he was actually at work.",
facts: "C was required to train cadets for the Army Proficiency Certificate and also to carry out administrative duties.
Although he was under a duty to comply with instructions given to him by his superior officers the ET found that
R was not under any obligation to provide any work for C and that C was not under any obligation to do the work
that was provided. The ET therefore considered that there was no mutuality of obligation and that he was not a
worker under DDA 1995, s.68.",
held: "The EAT rejected all three grounds of appeal. HHJ Birtles held that the Tribunal was entitled to find that C had
no obligation to work and rejected C’s perversity argument. The rejection of this ground of appeal also led HHJ
Birtles to reject the other two grounds. C’s second ground of appeal was that, under DDA 1995, s.68 the only
necessary obligation was an obligation on the employee to do work: an obligation on the employer to provide
work was not required. In other words that “a contract personally to do any work” did not require mutuality of
obligation. HHJ Birtles rejected this ground of appeal on the basis that the Tribunal had properly found that
there was no obligation on the employee in any event. Interestingly, HHJ Birtles stated obiter that he did not
consider that mutuality of obligation was a necessary element in a contract for service. The third ground of
appeal was also rejected on the basis that the Tribunal had held that there was no mutuality of obligation.",
comment: "DDA 1995, s.68 (and Equality Act 2010, s.83) require a person to be employed under a contract of or for services
before they are entitled to the protection against discrimination that is afforded to employees. Although the
lawfulness of these legislative provisions may shortly be considered by the Supreme Court in X v Mid Sussex
Citizen’s Advice Bureau (see 2011/Q1/p.7) the position at present remains that volunteers working without a
contract, are not protected by the equalities legislation.
Perhaps the most interest element of this case is HHJ Birtles’ obiter comment that mutuality of obligation is not
required in a contract for services, which, although not strictly relevant to disability discrimination is an
interesting idea nonetheless!")

keyword_list: "Direct Discrimination – Comparators – Disability Related Discrimination – Remission to the ET",
summary: "C made claims of disability discrimination. The ET concluded that: (i) he had been unfairly dismissed; (ii) he had
been directly discriminated against; and (iii) he had not been discriminated against for a reason related to his
disability. R appealed against the findings of direct disability discrimination. The EAT allowed the appeal but
remitted the matter to the ET. R appealed to the Court of Appeal on the basis that, on the facts found, there
was no need for a remission.",
facts: "C was employed as an executive director. He was injured during a ski trip and had to work restricted hours.
Notwithstanding his injuries he earned the bank $24.6 million of sales credit; an increase from the year before
when he did not have his disability. Although C was given a bonus of $400,000 he contended that it was not
enough since he had received $798,000 the year before when his sales had been lower. The ET concluded that
the reasons C was given a lower bonus included (i) the fact that C could not work full time; and (ii) the fact that it
was unnecessary to pay him a large bonus to encourage him to stay since his circumstances made it difficult for
him to find work elsewhere. After lodging a complaint about his bonus C was dismissed for redundancy. R said C
was selected for redundancy because he relied too heavily on one client and had not taken sufficient steps to
broaden his client base.
C lodged two separate claims, one in relation to his bonus and one in relation to his dismissal for redundancy.
He claimed both age and disability discrimination. The ET held that R would have given a smaller bonus to any
employee who had a narrow client base and who would have difficulty finding work elsewhere. The ET made
similar findings in respect of the dismissal. However, the ET allowed the direct discrimination claim and rejected
the disability related discrimination claim.",
held: "Unsurprisingly, R argued that the ET’s findings were contradictory and that the finding of direct discrimination
was incorrect. The EAT allowed the appeal and remitted the claim to the ET to consider afresh. R appealed and
argued that the EAT should have dismissed the claim and should not have remitted it.
The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal. Elias LJ held that the ET had erred in finding that disability played a part
in R’s reasons for giving C a small bonus or dismissing him. The conclusion that there was a connection between
C’s disability and his ability to work the hours necessary to increase his client base was insufficient to form the
basis of a direct discrimination claim since the ET had found that any non-disabled person working those hours
would have been treated the same way. In these circumstances there was no need for a remission.",
comment: "In this case R used the fact that C would have difficulty getting a job elsewhere as part of the reason for paying
him less money than others who did not have this difficulty. The ET’s finding that an able bodied person sharing
C’s characteristics (someone not able to work sufficient hours) would have been treated the same way was fatal
to the direct discrimination claim. This case illustrates how difficult it is to succeed in direct disability
discrimination claims. Since the comparator is required to have the same abilities as the claimant and since
disability is defined by ability, the comparator will almost always be a clone of the Claimant and direct
discrimination claims based on disability will almost always fail.")


Case.create(title: "Lancaster v TBWA Manchester UKEAT/0460/10/DA",
keyword_list: "Reasonable Adjustments – Whether Reasonable to Change Selection Criteria for Redundancy",
summary: "C claimed that, during a redundancy selection exercise, R had failed to make reasonable adjustments and had
discriminated against him on grounds of his age. The ET dismissed his complaint and C appealed to the EAT.",
facts: "C was a senior art director at a marketing and advertising agency. He was 50 years of age and suffered from a
panic and social anxiety disorder which amounted to a disability under the DDA 1995. He was dismissed for
redundancy. He was not consulted about the selection criteria. Three of the criteria were (a) ability to perform
as a team player, (b) influence on performance and attitude of others and (c) actively participating in company
activities and improving the organisation’s creative output. C scored lowest in the selection exercise and was
made redundant.",
held: "The two provisions, criteria or practices which were suggested by C were, either the application of the three
selection criteria listed above (1 st PCP), or alternatively the application of all of the selection criteria including the
three listed above (2 nd PCP). The ET held that the 1st PCP placed C at a substantial disadvantage because C had
an anxiety disorder. The ET then held that it was not a reasonable adjustment to remove those criteria because
removing them would have made no difference to the outcome of the assessment. The ET was unable to agree
whether the 2 nd PCP placed C at a substantial disadvantage in comparison with non-disabled persons. However
the ET held that, in any event, they were unable to say whether adjusting R’s criteria in the manner suggested by
C would have left him prevented him being selected for redundancy. C’s claim therefore failed.
The EAT held that the extent to which a PCP helped to prevent the disadvantage was a material consideration in
determining its reasonableness and that, where there was no prospect of the adjustment proposed achieving its
aim, it would not be a reasonable adjustment. Conversely where there was a real prospect of the adjustment
achieving the desired effect then it may be reasonable for the employer to take that course. It was not a
requirement that the Claimant prove that the adjustment would definitely remove the substantial disadvantage.",
comment: "Both the ET’s and the EAT’s approach to the 1 st PCP is confusing. On the one hand they say that the 1 st PCP
placed C at a substantial disadvantage (apparently because he had an anxiety disorder). On the other hand they
say nothing would have removed that disadvantage since C would have scored the lowest in the pool in any
event. This appears to require the adjustment to remedy a different but related disadvantage. I suggest that a
better approach is set out in Noor v Foreign & Commonwealth Office (see 2010/Q2.p5). The difference between
the outcomes in these two cases arises from the way in which the respective Cs described the disadvantage that
was caused by the PCP.
In relation to the 2 nd PCP the EAT held that the tribunal was also correct to reject the claim based on that PCP if
they were not satisfied, on the evidence, that any adjustments would have prevented C being selected for
redundancy.")


Case.create(title: "Newcastle City Council v Spires UKEAT/0334/10/ZT",
keyword_list: "Reasonable Adjustments – Constructive Dismissal – Whether Claiming Sick Pay Affirms Contract",
summary: "C succeeded in a claim of disability discrimination and constructive unfair dismissal in the ET. R appealed.",
facts: "C went off sick with stress and raised a grievance. She stated that her illness was stress related and was caused
by a lack of clarity around roles and responsibilities in her department. Her grievance was not dealt with. R’s
occupational health advisers initially stated that C would not be able to return to work until her grievance was
settled and she was assured about her work situation. Eventually C became unable to work for R again in any
capacity. C resigned when her sick pay expired and claimed that R had failed to place her on the redeployment
register or deal with her grievance.
The ET held that R was in breach of its duty to make reasonable adjustments, in breach of the implied term of
trust and confidence and in breach of the implied term that it would reasonably and promptly afford a
reasonable opportunity to employees to obtain redress of any grievance. R appealed on the basis that the ET
had erred in: (i) finding that R had failed to make adjustments which had not properly been in issue in the case;
(ii) finding that merely “considering” an adjustment could amount to a reasonable adjustment; and (iii) finding
that C had not affirmed the contract by continuing to claim sick pay.",
held: "The EAT allowed the appeal in respect of 3 of the 4 adjustments which the ET held should have been made as
they were not actually raised as issues during the ET case (following Chapman v Simon [1994] IRLR 124). The
finding in respect of the 4 th adjustment (a failure to consider redeployment) was an error of law since “merely
going through the mental process of considering a potential step cannot amount to a ‘step’ for the purposes of
section 4A.” However, the EAT agreed that the duty to make adjustments had arisen and, since the ET did not
address the question of whether R had failed to place C on the redeployment register, the EAT remitted this part
of the case to the ET.
The EAT also dismissed the other grounds of appeal. The failure to address C’s grievance was a fundamental
breach of contract. C was entitled to continue claiming sick pay and it was open to C to accept the breach so
long as R remained in fundamental breach of contract. There was no rule of law that an ET must hold that an
employee who accepts sick pay has affirmed the contract or waived the fundamental breach.",
comment: "One of the most frequent appeals in reasonable adjustments cases arises where an ET finds that a respondent
has failed to “consider” an adjustment. “Considering” an adjustment is not making a reasonable adjustment.
For instance, a finding that R has failed to consider medical advice is largely irrelevant to whether or not R has
failed to implement the recommendations made by that advice. The leading case in this area is Tarbuck v
Sainsburys Supermarket [2006] IRLR 664.
Practitioners will also be familiar with claimants who resign after a protracted period of absence when their sick
pay has been exhausted. Employers who delay dealing with issues while an employee is on sick leave risk facing
an unfair constructive dismissal claim even at the end of the sick leave even if the sick leave has been lengthy.")

Adjustment",
summary: "C was applied for a position with R and claimed he was discriminated against during the recruitment process. His
case was struck out at a preliminary hearing. The ET held that C’s suggested adjustments were unreasonable
because, even if they had been made, C would still not have been offered the job. C appealed.",
facts: "C suffered from dyslexia and dyspraxia. He applied for a job as an immigration officer. The job advertisement
mistakenly listed only 4 key competencies when 5 were required. C completed an application form which
provided evidence of the 4 key competencies and which also informed R about his disabilities. As an adjustment
R allowed C to have 50% more time at his interview and permitted C to write down the panel’s questions.
During the interview C was asked about the 5 th key competency. He was surprised but did his best to answer.
He raised the problem of the additional key competency in his interview and wrote a polite letter of complaint
afterwards. C asserted to both R and later to the ET that it would be a reasonable adjustment to re-interview
him. The ET struck out his complaint following a preliminary hearing in which R produced the marking sheets for
the other candidates. These showed that even if C had received the maximum score for the 5 th key competency
he would not have been selected for the post. The ET held that re-interviewing C could not be a reasonable
adjustment since it would have made no difference to the outcome of the selection process and therefore his
claim had no reasonable prospect of success.",
held: "The EAT allowed the appeal. His Honour Judge Richardson, relying on Project Management Institute v Latif
[2007] IRLR 579 (see Art, NLJ, Oct 2007) stated that an employment judge considering a strike out had to bear
firmly in mind the shifting burden of proof in reasonable adjustments cases and the fact that an adjustment
might not be identified until a late stage in the proceedings. His Honour stated that “It is certainly not the law
that an adjustment will only be reasonable if it is completely effective” (see para. 33). His Honour also disagreed
with the ET’s analysis of the disadvantage caused by the PCP. The purpose of the adjustment was to eliminate
the practical difficulty and embarrassment which the PCP caused and to create a level playing field for the
disabled person in interview. It was not fatal to C’s case that he or she would not have obtained the job
although it was obviously relevant to quantum.",
comment: "The difference between the outcome in this case and that in Lancaster v TBWA (see 2011/Q1/p.3) is striking and
derives from the description given to the disadvantages caused by the respective PCP. Where the disadvantage
was described as failing to get/keep the job then no adjustments were reasonable since no adjustments would
have remedied that disadvantage. Where, on the other hand, the disadvantage was the inability to compete on
a level playing field then reasonable adjustments could have done something to alleviate that disadvantage.
In Q1 I considered the case of Thameside Hospital v Mylott (2001/Q1/p.6). In that case Underhill P set out the
extent to which an adjustment must prevent a disadvantage before an employer is required to make it. Despite
appearances both this case and Lancaster are consistent with the approach of Underhill J.")

summary: "C presented an ET1 complaining of unfair constructive dismissal on 11.09.09. On 12.01.10 she wrote to ET asking

facts: "C was a GP employed by R. She suffered from neurosarcoidosis. The ET1 stated that C suffered from
neurosarcoidosis and diabetes. It also alleged that as a result of her increased workload she did not even have
time to have a sandwich and could not therefore eat regularly, which is essential for persons suffering from
diabetes. It made specific complaint about her manager’s conduct and about her workload in June 2009.
Despite these assertions the ET1 did not make a claim for disability discrimination. C applied in January 2010 to
add claims under the DDA 1995 which included a failure to make reasonable adjustments in respect of her
increased workload.",
held: "HHJ Clark allowed the appeal in respect of a broad claim that R had failed to make adjustments over a period
from 2002 to May 2009. The ET judge had described the addition of a claim in respect of this period as a re-
labeling exercise. However, the allegations of discrimination over this long period of time were not referred to in
the ET1 and the ET judge had not given any indication that he would be prepared to extend the time limit to
allow the claims to be brought. HHJ Clark followed the approach of the Court of Appeal in Housing Corporation v
Bryant [1999] ICR 123 and held that, in the absence of a causal link between the primary facts pleaded and the
DDA 1995, the decision to allow the amendment on the basis that it was a mere relabeling exercise was wrong.
However, HHJ Clark refused the appeal in part and upheld the ET’s decision to allow an amendment to the ET1 to
add a claim of a failure to make reasonable adjustments in June 2009. The factual matters relied upon for the
new discrimination claim had been raised in the ET1 but it was immaterial whether one called the amendment a
relabeling exercise or a new cause of action because the ET judge had indicated that he would have granted an
extension of time in any event. HHJ Clark agreed with the ET’s decision to extend time in respect of the
allegations in June 2009. Since no new factual matters were relied upon the extension of time would not
increase the complexity or length of the hearing and no new evidence would be required. The balance of justice
therefore required that C be permitted to make the amendment.",
comment: "The most interesting part of this case is HHJ Clark’s approach to the question of whether the addition of the new
DDA claims was merely a relabeling exercise. Even though no new facts were relied upon by C and no new
evidence was required, HHJ Clark held that the addition of the DDA claims was not a relabeling exercise because
there was no causative link between the primary facts and the consequences under the DDA that were
contended for by way of an amendment.")

R refused to consider C’s ongoing concerns and C resigned.  C claimed that R had failed to make reasonable adjustments.  The ET upheld the claim and R appealed.",
facts: "C had been employed by R for many years.  In 2006 his relationship with his line manager broke down. He was signed off work from October 2006 with stress and never returned.  After commencing sick leave C lodged a grievance that alleged he had been bullied.   R rejected the grievance.  R’s occupational health department (“OH”) advised that C was fit to return to work and so R told C that he would have to return work in the security department.  However, after another meeting with C, OH advised that although R took the view that the grievance had been resolved C did not share that view and that for C the problem, rightly or wrongly, still existed.  OH advised that, so long as C held this view, he would not be able to return to work in the security department.  Initially R took the view that the grievance had been dealt with and that if C could not work in the security department he should be dismissed.  However, In late 2008 C was placed on the redeployment register for 3 months but no post was found.  The line manager who had allegedly bullied C then left the security department.  As a result C informed R that he could now return to work but that he would like to discuss his ongoing concerns with R.  Unfortunately R refused to enter into any discussions with C and C then became unfit for work again.   This time OH could not say when C would be fit to return so R dismissed him for capability.",
held: "The ET held that R should have made the reasonable adjustment of placing C on the redeployment register in January 2008.  The ET concluded that had R done so there was a real prospect of C returning to work.  R challenged this finding on the basis that C had not proved facts from which the ET could conclude that there was a good or real prospect that C would have been redeployed.  The EAT rejected R’s submissions.  Firstly it was sufficient if there was only “a prospect” of redeployment.  It did not need to be a “good” or “real” prospect.  Secondly the ET was only having to decide whether, as at January 2008, there was a prospect that a post suitable for C would become available.  The EAT held that the mere fact that R was a very large employer (15,000) employees was sufficient on its own to entitle the ET to come to the conclusion that there was a good prospect that a post for C would become available.",
comment: "This is an important case for those considering a respondent’s duty to look for an alternative post for a disabled person who is unable to perform his/her own role.  This case is a reminder that the effectiveness of an adjustment should be considered as at the time it was required.  Many employers seek to argue that since no suitable post ever became available, the adjustment of placing the employee on the redeployment register was not required because it would have made no difference.  This is unlikely to be a sufficient defence, particularly where larger employers are concerned.  If a person is placed on a large employer’s re-deployment register there will, more often that not, be a prospect of a vacancy becoming available.  In these circumstances evidence, with hindsight, that no vacancies did actually arise is only likely to be relevant to quantum.")

keyword_list: " 	Reasonable Adjustments – Time Limits – Extension of Time",
summary: "C alleged that R had failed to make reasonable adjustments.  The ET held that her claim was presented out of time and refused to grant an extension of time.  C appealed.",
facts: "C was a ticket inspector on buses.  She had to generate reports using a template.  She had difficulty reading and writing and was diagnosed as dyslexic.  In May 2006 C was assessed by R’s consultant who recommended that she have a screen reader and voice recognition software.  There was a delay in providing the software and C lodged a grievance in October 2008.  R then provided C with the software to help her with reading and writing but did not provide any training on how to use it despite repeated requests.  C eventually wrote a letter dated 28.01.09 complaining that R had failed to make reasonable adjustments for her disability by not training her in the use of the software.  At around the same time R also made a conscious decision to only provide C with a DVD - so that she could train herself.  C presented her ET1 on 04.10.09.  The ET held that her claim was out of time and refused to extend time.  C appealed on the basis that the discretion to extend time was wrongly exercised.",
held: "The ET referred to the case of Matuszowicz v Kingston Upon Hull City Council [2009] IRLR 95 (see Art/NLJ/July 2009), and held that time started to run when R ought reasonably to have made the adjustment or when a conscious decision had been made not to provide the adjustment.  As a result the ET concluded that time started to run at some point prior to 28.01.09, when C had written her letter of complaint.  The ET made this finding even though it had not indicated to the parties that it considered 28.01.09 to be a crucial date.
C appealed on the basis that the ET had erred in not bringing to the parties’ attention the reliance it was going to place on the letter dated 28.01.09.  The EAT rejected C’s appeal.  The EAT commented that the fact that C continued to complain about R’s failure and the fact that R had indicated that it would act could “not reasonably have affected the judgment of a tribunal as to whether or not it was just and equitable to extent time.”  The appeal was therefore academic since time would not have been extended even if the ET had told the parties its view.",
comment: "This case is a reminder of the significance of time limits in reasonable adjustments cases.  In Matuszowicz v Kingston Upon Hull City Council the Court of Appeal stated that the harshness of the rules in Schedule 3(3) of the DDA 1995 could be mitigated by a flexible approach to extending time.  However, the EAT’s approach in this case does not seem to reflect that.  In particular it is surprising that the EAT considered that it was irrelevant that C was complaining about R’s alleged failures and that R was promising to implement adjustments.  
This case will encourage respondents to take preliminary points in reasonable adjustments cases more often.")



Case.create(title: "R (on the application of Rahman) v Birmingham City Council [2011] EWHC 944 (Admin)",

keyword_list: " 	Judicial Review – Public Sector Equality Duty – Defective Equality Impact Assessment",
summary: "The Cs were users of a service (LEAS) which provided free advice on various matters to the local community.  D made a decision which interrupted the funding of the scheme and Cs applied for a judicial review of the decision.",
facts: "Cs were comprised of members of the local community that were using the services of the LEAS.  Some of the Cs had difficulty communicating in English because it was not their native tongue and others suffered from various physical or mental impairments.  D made a decision to terminate the funding of those organizations providing legal entitlement advice before any funding for an alternative scheme was in place.  This meant that there would be a gap in service when no free advice would be available.  Although D had prepared an Equality Impact Assessment (EIA) the EIA was not referred to in the documents or the report which was used by the Counselors taking the decision.  After Cs’ challenge had been lodged D made a fresh decision in which they considered the EIA but reached the same conclusion.  Cs argued that the 1st decision was unlawful because:  (1) it was taken without consultation with the LEAS or their users; (2) it was taken in breach of the Public Sector Equality Duty (PSED); (3) it was irrational because it failed to consider relevant facts and/or took into account irrelevant facts.  The C’s argued that the 2nd decision was unlawful because it: (1) was not based upon a consultation with the affected users; (2) was inherently flawed; (3) failed to have regard to the PSED.",
held: "Mr Justice Blake held that D’s most significant failure was its failure to have “due regard” to the PSED.  He suggested that 6 general principles could be derived from the authorities: (1) those in the public authority who make a decision must be made aware of their duty to have due regard to the goals of the PSED; (2) the duty to have “due regard” must be fulfilled before and at the time that a particular policy that will or might affect disabled people is being considered; (3) the duty must be exercised in substance, with rigour, and with an open mind and must be integrated within the discharge of the public function as opposed to merely ticking boxes; (4) the duty is not delegable and remains on the public authority charged with it; (5) the duty is a continuing one; (6) it is good practice for the public authority to keep notes recording its consideration of the PSED.  
Mr Justice Blake held that what was “due” depended on what was proper and appropriate in the circumstances and that it was insufficient for the decision makers to be aware of the PSED.  They had to apply it.  The 1st decision was defective because it did not have regard to the PSED.  The 2nd decision was defective because the public authority had regard to the defective EIA and not the PSED.   The EIA was defective because it did not focus on the disadvantage that would be caused to users by the termination of the funding arrangements and was not based upon a proper consultation with affected users.  Mr Justice Blake made a declaration that the decisions were unlawful because they were made without due regard to the PSED.",
comment: "The two judicial review cases summarised this quarter illustrate the breadth of the challenges that can be made to a public authority which is making a decision that has an adverse impact on disabled persons.  Cs are not required to show that the authority has not had “due regard” to the PSED in a Wednesbury unreasonableness sense.  The Court is able to conduct a broader examination of whether the PSED has been satisfied (see para. 56 in which Mr Justice Blake relying on R (Meany & Others) v Harlow District Council [2009]  EWHC 559 (Admin)).")



Case.create(title: "R (on the application of W) v Birmingham City Council [2011] EWHC 1147 (Admin)",
keyword_list: " 	Judicial Review – Public Sector Equality Duty – Defective Equality Impact Assessment",
summary: "The Cs were all severely disabled adults living in Birmingham.  D decided to confine the caring support it provided to a more limited range of people.   The Cs sought to challenge this decision.  One of the principle grounds of challenge was that D had failed to have regard to the Public Sector Equality Duty (PSED).",
facts: "Prior to the financial year 2011/2012 D had provided support for those whose needs were assessed as “substantial” or “critical”.  After 2011/2012 D decided only to provide support to those whose needs were “critical”.  When making this decision D produced and had regard to an Equality Impact Assessment (EIA).  Cs argued that: (1) in order to have “due regard” to the PSED, D had to consider whether savings could be found in other areas in order to maintain the level of spending on adult social care; and (2) that the EIA was inadequate as it did not consider the impact on disabled people or the merits of other approaches.",
held: "Mr Justice Walker held that, in deciding to restrict care to those whose needs were “critical” that D had failed to have due regard to the PSED.  When making its decision D had not asked itself the right questions.  D should have considered the impact of the proposed decision and asked itself whether a decision with that impact would be consistent with the need to pay due regard to the principles of disability equality.  Furthermore, the EIA had not addressed the question of whether the consequences were so serious that a less draconian alternative should be considered.  Finally, the consultation undertaken by D did not attempt to address the practical detail of what supporting only those with “critical” needs would entail.  The Judge asked the parties to agree an appropriate order.",
comment: "This is another case in which the decisions of a local authority have been subject to a successful judicial review.  It demonstrates the extent to which Courts are prepared to examine in detail the decisions of a public authority and also that Courts are not shying away from overturning decisions where it looks as though mere lip service has been paid to the PSED.  In this case the evidence produced by D to show that it had complied with the PSED was found wanting, even to the extent that the Court held that the EIA that D had produced was inadequate.
JRs based on the PSED are likely to become more frequent as claimants and their lawyers appreciate the extent to which the courts are prepared to scrutinise decisions that may have an adverse impact on persons with a protected characteristic.")

keyword_list: " 	Direct Disability Discrimination – Constructive Knowledge – Reliance on Medical Evidence",
summary: "C suffered from agoraphobia which gave her travel anxiety and prevented her from using public transport.  She asked to work closer to her home and resigned when R refused to move her on a permanent basis.  The ET held that R did not have sufficient knowledge of her disability for any duty to make adjustments to arise.",
facts: "C was required to take a pay cut which meant that she could no longer afford to pay for parking.  C did not wish to use public transport and asked to work closer to home.  R’s CEO met with C and asked her why she would not use public transport and whether there was an underlying medical condition preventing her from using it.  C said that using public transport made her anxious but that she had never investigated whether there was an underlying medical condition.  C followed up the request in writing but did not mention her travel anxiety.  C was not moved to the bureau she requested and was then signed off sick with “work related stress”, never to return to work.  
During C’s sick leave the parties continued to communicate as a result of R’s attendance management procedure and a grievance that C had lodged.  Initially C did not mention her travel anxiety.  C also tried to delay R’s attempts to procure a medical report because she was embarrassed about her condition.  Eventually R obtained a report produced by C’s GP which stated that the Appellant was suffering from a great deal of anxiety about travelling and which recommended that she be allowed work at a venue closer to home.  R would not agree the move on a permanent basis since it was subject to the exigencies of the LSC contract.  C refused to see R’s own occupational health advisors.  R’s advisors produced a report based on C’s medical notes which stated that “there was no substantial evidence of a psychiatric diagnosis” and no medical grounds for absence from work or alternative travel arrangements.  During the ET proceedings, after C had resigned, C instructed an expert, Mr Briscoe, to provide a medical report.",
held: "The ET held that R did not know and could not be expected to know, before it received Mr Briscoe’s report, that C was disabled.  C appealed and argued that the ET’s finding that R could not be expected to know about C’s disability was perverse.  The EAT rejected the appeal.  Although the EAT described itself as troubled by the conclusion that R did not have actual or constructive knowledge after receiving the GP’s report it upheld the ET’s decision.   Even though R could have constructive knowledge when there was no precise diagnosis the question of whether constructive knowledge should be imposed was a question of fact.  The ET was entitled to find that R did not have actual or constructive knowledge until it was able to obtain “authoritative medical advice”, not least because in this case it was difficult to disentangle the effects of any mental impairment from C’s unhappiness about her working conditions.  The finding that R did not know of C’s disability also led the EAT to reject the direct discrimination appeal.  Finally, the EAT upheld the ET’s finding that the claimed adjustment was unreasonable.",
comment: "Only imposing constructive knowledge on an employer if they have an “authoritative” medical opinion is, on the face of it a surprising proposition.   However, the question of whether a respondent has constructive knowledge is a question of fact.  Where a claimant has made it difficult to obtain independent advice about their disability and the employment relationship is under strain, respondents would appear to be able to argue that they were entitled to be skeptical about assertions made by the claimant about his/her disability and to wait for their own medical advice.")


Case.create(title: "Salford NHS Primary Care Trust v Smith UKEAT/0005/11/JOJ",
keyword_list: "Reasonable Adjustments – Constructive Dismissal – Light Duties – Career Break",
summary: "C was a physiotherapist who suffered from chronic fatigue syndrome. She went on long term sick leave and was
unable to return to her post or to perform any productive work. She claimed that R had failed to make
adjustments to facilitate her return to work. The ET upheld her claim and R appealed.",
facts: "C went on sick leave on 29.03.07. She was certificated with a chest infection but did not return to work because of
post viral fatigue syndrome and in fact she was never certified for work again in any capacity. R’s OH physician
advised that C was not fit for work but that R should do a number of things to prepare C for an eventual return to
work such as carrying out an stress risk assessment or an optional career break. OH expected that in the long
term C would make a good recovery. R explored with C other options for redeployment but C did not consider any
of the options to be suitable. Eventually R wrote to C stating that it would have to consider whether or not to
terminate her employment. When C received this letter she resigned and claimed that she had been unfairly
dismissed and discriminated against.",
held: "The ET held that R had failed to make the reasonable adjustment of providing C with something to do by way of
rehabilitation such as 2 or 3 hours work a week. C argued that this would have allowed her doctor to confirm that
she was fit to work. The ET also held that this had led to C’s resignation and that she therefore had been
constructively unfairly dismissed. R appealed and argued that the adjustment referred to by the ET was not in law
a reasonable adjustment (relying upon Tarbuck v Sainsbury’s Supermarkets Ltd [2006] IRLR 664). The EAT upheld
the appeal. It considered that the PCP was the expectation that C would perform her full role within the
contracted hours and that C was placed at a substantial disadvantage by this as she was unable to work full time
as a result of her disability. The EAT held that “adjustments that do not have the effect of alleviating the disabled
person’s substantial disadvantage ..as we have set it out above are not reasonable adjustments within the
meaning of the Act. Matters such as consultations and trials, exploratory investigations and the like do not
qualify.” The proposed career break was not a reasonable adjustment because it did nothing to alleviate the
substantial disadvantage. The EAT also rejected the notion that non-productive “light duties” was a reasonable
adjustment although its reasons for doing so are unclear. There is a suggestion that the light duties would not
have “mitigated” the effects of the PCP.",
comment: "The EAT in this case appeared to require the PCP to actually “prevent” the disadvantage. There is a lack of clarity
from the EAT over precisely how effective an adjustment must be before it is obligatory to make it (see the 2011
Q2 Newsletter). The effectiveness of an adjustment may be better dealt with when considering whether the
adjustment was reasonable rather than when considering whether the duty arises. For instance, in the above case
it is unclear why allowing C to work for 2 hours a week for as long as it took for her to recover would not have
done something to alleviate the disadvantage of not being able to work full time. The medical evidence indicated
that she would eventually recover. Allowing her to work a few hours would have kept her in contact with the
workforce, would have given her some income and would have allowed her to slip more easily back into full time
work once she had recovered. The real question was whether or not it was reasonable for the employer to have
been required to provide her with this sort of work in these circumstances.")
